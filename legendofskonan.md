Back in the days when the Gods have not yet ascended the Sacred Mountain there lived a young cyclops named Skónan and his two brothers. They lived a simple life, they plucked sheep or goats from the fields surrounding their cave and collected the shiny stones that the mountain streams kept dragging in.

Once in a while a little cyclops with an extra eye next to his primary called "Merchant" would come along and trade the shiny stones for tools and cloth with Skónan and his brothers.
