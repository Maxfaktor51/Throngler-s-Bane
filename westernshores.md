# The Western Shores
The [*Western Shores*](./glossary.md#western-shores) are rugged and diverse and home to a mix of human settlements and dwarven mining communities. Valuable ore from the mountains is mined and transported to the great polis, where skillfull craftmen turn it into weapons, tools, building materials or jewelry.

Despite their differences, the humans and dwarves of the [*Western Shores*](./glossary.md#western-shores) have learned to coexist and even collaborate, trading goods and services and sharing their knowledge and expertise. Together, they separated from the [*Kingdom of Epsylón*](./glossary.md#kingdom-of-epsylón), founding their own, independent [*Kingdom of Nabla*](./glossary.md#kingdom-of-nabla), an industrious society which leaves many scars in the mountains and forests of the [*Western Shores*](./glossary.md#western-shores).

The region is further split into three provinces [*Boréa*](#province-of-boréa), [*Malária*](#province-of-malária) and [*Théa*](#province-of-théa).

<div><img src="./images/highlight_borea.png" id="fright">

[*Boréa*](./glossary.md#boréa) is the northern most province of the [*Western Shores*](./glossary.md#western-shores). Heropolis and the two dwarven citadels Oktogón and Gambrinos can be found here, as well as the western half of the Dark forest, the northern end of the Marshes of Malaria and the Frostwind Steppe.</div>

### Heropolis

The largest city in Boréa, Heropolis lies deep in the [*Dark Forest*](./glossary.md#dark-forest) and is accessible only by dwarven tunnels and the sea. Being so close to the border, the city is often besieged by either side of the [*Three Kingdom War*](./glossary.md#three-kingdom-war).

### Oktogón and Gambrinos

The two remaining settled dwarven citadels on the surface, Oktogón and Gambrinos lay above the ancient dwarven highway that cross the Marshes of Malária.
