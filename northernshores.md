# The Northern Shores
Though the elders all agree that modern civilisation as we know it was established by Ephara at the foot of the Sacred Mountain, the Northern Shores are now considered the home of the cultured and civilised. It was here where King Summant unified the tribes of elves, men, centaurs and dwarves againt the cyclopean tyranny and founded the ancient Kingdom of Epsylón.
