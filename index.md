**Ahoj, noble seeker of knowledge!**  
You found the wiki for my Dungeons and Dragons campaign. If you are new here I suggest reading the [overview](./overview.md) - if you already know what you are looking for, I suggest browsing the [glossary](./glossary.md).

Please note that this wiki is a constant work in progress and content is most likely due to change as the PCs bring inevitable chaos upon this beautiful world.

Also note that since this serves as a reference for the game master as well, it thusly may contain spoilers, hence **if you are a player DO NOT browse the repo or click on pages marked as spoiler, it will ruin the game for you!**

You have been warned. Happy reading!

Cheers,  
Max
