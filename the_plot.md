In order to achieve goodhood, a dark evil entity called [*Prince Morbogh of Eternal Doom*](./glossary.md#prince-morbogh-of-eternal-doom) from the [*Darkness before Time*](./glossary.md#darkness-before-time) made a pact with the sorceress [*Mellisanthé the Cruel*](./glossary.md#mellisanthé-the-cruel): he provides the sorceress with exceptional dark powers and so that she in return executes his mischievous plans of world domination.

This [*evil masterplan*](./glossary.md#cult-of-silence) is has three requirements that need to be fullfilled before it can be executed: the securing of knowledge, might and magic. Once all three have been satisfied, the final stage begins. [*Mellisanthé*](./glossary.md#mellisanthé-the-cruel) and her minions will be constantly and devotedly working toward this goal.

At the beginning of the campaign most of the foundation work for all three pillars of the masterplan has been completed and further advancements are underway in the background. A well spread network of agents and spies has been established to provide [*Mellisanthé*](./glossary.md#mellisanthé-the-cruel) with information. Magical powers and the favor of [*Morbogh*](./glossary.md#prince-morbogh-of-eternal-doom) are being secured by the [*Cult of Silence*](./glossary.md#cult-of-silence). The sorceress herself has just finished work on her super warrior, the Throngler and has now begun research into necromancy in order to raise the [*Eternal Army*](./glossary.md#eternal-army).

## Act II - Wrath of Gods

As [*Morbogh's*](./glossary.md#prince-morbogh-of-eternal-doom) three pillars plan is in full motion, even the [*Gods*](./glossary.md#pantheon) begin to take notice and send down a [*massive storm*](./glossary.md#cleansing-wind) to cleanse and punish the mortals.
