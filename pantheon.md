# The Pantheon of Akínitos

The pantheon of [*Akínitos*](./glossary.md#akínitos) is formed by fifteen gods who according to legends all meet in a golden palace atop the [*Sacred Mountain*](./glossary.md#sacred-mountain) and decide upon the destiny of the [*Summer Sea*](./glossary.md#summer-sea). Furthermore each god has their own domain of life for which they are responsible - these are explained below.

While all gods have their dedicated priests and followers, the average mortal living along the [*Summer Sea*](./glossary.md#summer-sea) worships multiple gods at the same time, depending on their surroundings and profession.
